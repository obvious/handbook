# Publishing + Style Guide

### Introduction

Welcome to the Obvious publishing and style guide, your best friend while you pen down your thoughts. If our playbook tells readers **how** we do things, our publications tell them **what** __we do and __**why** we do them. This guide is aimed to act as a reference and help team Obvious write clear and consistent content across channels. 

### **Writing goals** 

With every piece of content we publish, we aim to:

* **Enable** - Help readers understand our point of view as clearly and concisely as possible to ensure they absorb key takeaways from useful content
* **Educate** - Focus on our strengths and strive to inform readers of our stories in a way that makes them curious to learn more
* **Empower** - Give readers an insight into our forte and guide them on what they need to know, not just what we want to say
