# Publication Guidelines

Our publication guidelines outline the rough process of producing written content for Obvious, from submitting the first draft to sharing published content on personal websites and social media. 

### The publication process

Although not set in stone, this is a general overview of the publication process:

**1. First draft approval**  
Since a lot of the material produced is specialised in nature, we get our team leads to sign off on the first draft before sending it to the communications team.

**2. Editing**  
Depending on the nature of the article, the content might have to go through two or more editing rounds - specialist or stylistic.

**3. Publication timelines**  
While the timelines will vary on a case to case basis, we usually account for a two-week window for any edits and revisions from either end and depending on the content already present in the pipeline.

**4. Promotions**  
Once published, the content will be amplified on all social media channels and newsletters.

### Resharing

We absolutely love your content and want it to shine.

Once we've published it on the Obvious website and/or other platforms, please feel free to add a link to it on your personal website and social mediaâ€“ much like how Simple's Daniel Burka links his external writing to his [personal website](https://danielburka.com/).
