# Engineering Growth Framework

> The framework is divided into 3 parts - **Creating**, **Executing** and **Supporting**, each of which has 3-4 different skills. Each skill is further divided into 5 different milestones. As you go deeper or take on more responsibilities, you cross a milestone.

## The 5C Rule <a id="4cceac9b-a339-430e-bf3c-b0944a460aa9"></a>

You do not achieve a milestone the first time you demonstrate relevant behaviours or tasks. If it is not clear that you're at a certain milestone, then you'll be placed at the previous milestone. The first milestone that everyone starts with is Milestone 0, and not Milestone 1!

In general, you must have demonstrated a "Conscious, Comfortable, Continuous, Consistent Competency" defined as follows:

* **Conscious:** having devoted intentional effort to this endeavour,
* **Comfortable:** without being overly stretched,
* **Continuous:** for a reasonable period of time,
* **Consistent:** reliably and evenly,
* **Competency:** meeting the criteria.

**Dependability**: You can be depended upon to deliver a task
