# Evolving guidelines for moving geographies

**Moving geographies** 

Many of us have families in other cities and might want to move to be closer to them so as to give and receive support, as the pandemic runs its course across the country. Or we might want to move to a favoured location temporarily or permanently.  

**The communication process on moving out of Bangalore**

Any employee looking to move out of Bangalore needs to keep their manager and People Ops informed **5 working days in advance**. This helps us plan better and make sure that the move is smooth for the person and for the team members. It also helps us be aware of quarantine protocol to the place they are moving to, their availability during that time, and so on. 

They will keep everyone informed by way of a quick announcement at the townhall, just before heading out. Presumably, their teams will know beforehand.  

**Office hardware while moving geographies**

All hardware except the laptop issued to the person needs to be sent to the office prior to the move. They need to coordinate this with the office management folk and get the hardware delivered to the office before their travel date. 

Any office furniture that was moved to home office would also need to be shipped back to the office before moving out of Bangalore.

If you are moving indefinitely, follow the same process as above. Once you are back, you can bring the same setup from office back home. 

If you are moving indefinitely and are keeping your things in storage, move any office furniture back. Again, once you are back in town, you can requisition for the setup in your new place. 

**One-time WFH fund**

For people who'd like help in putting together a stronger infrastructure - a better router, perhaps - there is a one-time fund of Rs. 10,000 to be availed. 

This can be used by people in other locations to buy hardware as well.  

**For people in Bangalore: Hardware shifted to home offices**

For the roughly 50% people working remotely from Bangalore, hardware ranging from monitors to standing desks and chairs have been delivered home, so that they can function as they did at the office.

For non-Bangalore folk, we are developing a set of guidelines, so that they are able to furnish their home office with ergonomic desks and chairs.
